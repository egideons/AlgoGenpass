# AlgoGenPass

AlgoGenPass - generate password by cryptographic algorithms

Generate strong passwords using a cryptographic hash algorithms.

By remembering one passphrase, you can generate and use different and strong passwords for each sites.

Passwords are generated from a combination of a site (domain) name and a passphrase using a cryptographic hash algorithms. Any single difference in the site name or passphrase will result in a completely different password. It is cryptographically difficult to calculate the original combination from the generated password.

The passphrase and password will not be saved at all. Because the same combination of site name and passphrase always results in the same password, so saving is not necessary and there is no management risk.

Only the history of the site name is saved as data in the app for input assistance.

In addition, this application does not use the network and does not send data. You can check with the application's permissions from the system setting.
